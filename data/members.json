The wiki went independent about a year later when it merged with the Dragon Quest Dictionary/Encyclopedia which was run by Zenithian and supported by the Dragon's Den.  The Dragon Quest Wiki aims to be the most complete resource for Dragon Quest information on the web. It continues to grow in the hope that one day the series will be as popular in the rest of the world as it is in Japan.",
